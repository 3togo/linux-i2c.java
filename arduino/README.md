This Arduino program is meant to be used on an Arduino Mega for testing IO
operations, whether in developpment or during unit tests.

The `Makefile` file is meant for
[Arduino-Makefile](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile) and is configured
for an Arduino Mega and Ubuntu. A simple solution for flashing the program onto
the Arduino is simply to use the Arduino IDE.
